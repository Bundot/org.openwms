== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

=== Business Context

The Common Service is a central service used by many other services of the Transport Management (TMS) domain and the Warehouse Management (WMS)
domain. Itself does not depend or use other OpenWMS.org services, hence it can be seen as the essential base service of each system.

| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Common Service | Base service of the COMMON domain responsible to manage `TransportUnits`, `Locations` and `LocationGroups`. Functionality if offered as a REST API over HTTP and an asynchronous command API
| User Interface | An user interface, ie. for operators, may interact with the Common Service
| Transport Management Services | All services of the automatic and manual transport management may access the Common Service directly
| Warehouse Management Services | All services of the warehouse management domain may interact with the Common Service directly

| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Location | A `Location`, represents a physical or virtual place in a warehouse. Could be something like a storage location in the stock or a conveyor location. Even error locations can be represented with the `Location`. Multiple Locations with same characteristics are grouped to a `LocationGroup`
| LocationGroup | A `LocationGroup` is a logical group of `Locations` with same characteristics
| Target | A `Target` is either a physical or a logical endpoint of any kind of warehouse order. A `TransportOrder` has a `Target` assigned where it has to be moved to
| TransportUnit | A `TransportUnit` is an item like a box, a toad, a bin or a pallet that is moved within a warehouse and can carry goods. It can be moved between `Location`s
| TransportUnitType | A `TransportUnitType` is a type of a certain `TransportUnit`. Typically to store characteristic attributes of `TransportUnits`, such as the length, the height, or the weight of `TransportUnits`

=== Technical Context

The Technical Context illustrates interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking the system to its environment. In addition a mapping
of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

The Common Service exposes several resources over HTTP REST. The current available and detailed interface description can be found https://openwms.github.io/org.openwms.common.service/rest/1.6.0-SNAPSHOT/api.html[here].
In addition the service sends event notifications out to surrounding services about master data changes and actions that occur within the
service.

It offers an asynchronous API to trigger actions via commands from the outside.

| **Name** | **Type** | **Responsibility**
| REST API | Synchronous API over HTTP | API to retrieve data from and to trigger actions on the Common domain objects
| common.lg | RabbitMQ Exchange | Outgoing exchange to send events according to changes on `Locations` and `LocationGroups`
| common.tu | RabbitMQ Exchange | Outgoing exchange to send events according to changes on `TransportUnits`
| common.tu.commands | RabbitMQ Exchange | An exchange where the service binds an receiving queue to, in order to get commands to process. This exchange is defined by the Common Service
| inventory-tu-command-queue | RabbitMQ Queue | The incoming queue bound to the inventory exchange that actually receives the commands on the WMS Inventory Service
| WMS Inventory Service | OpenWMS.org Microservice | The Inventory service is sending commands to the Common Service' exchange
