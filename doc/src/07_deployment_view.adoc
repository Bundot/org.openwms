=== On-Premise Deployment

Most often a warehouse management system and material flow control are installed in a datacenter close to the warehouse, either on a single
server or on multiple ones. This on-premise deployment has the advantage of increased availability and latency.

==== Simple Single Box Deployment
The simplest way to deploy OpenWMS.org is the Single Box deployment. All components installed on one single physical or virtual  server. All
processes run and communicate in-memory and do not require an external network access. In its simplest way all the microservices can be
installed as single instances as Unix daemons or MS Windows services. Scalability and elasticity are not an option in a typical warehouse
project, therefor there is no need to scale out processes on demand.

The services could also be installed as Docker containers to increase operability and reliability but this is not required.

Motivation::

- Simple project setup
- One OpenWMS.org system for one warehouse project, no need to combine other OpenWMS.org instances
- Independent IT systems operated by the warehouse management team
- No need to scale out, the load and frequency is known for present and for the future

Quality and/or Performance Features::
- High degree of latency
- High level of operability
- In multiple warehouse projects per site the maintainability decreases

| **Component** | **Responsibility**
| Server           | Either one physical or virtual server instance for the whole warehouse project

| Virtual Host    | Inside the RabbiteMQ server a https://www.rabbitmq.com/vhosts.html[virtual host] instance is created for the warehouse

| Database Server | A database server installation
| Database Instance   | A instance dedicated for the warehouse project, that contains all schemas and tables (the feature of schema is
optional)
| Microservice Network    | A logical group of microservices. Has no
