== Building Block View

=== The Abstract View

OpenWMS.org is made up microservices that communicate between each other in a variety of protocols either in synchronous or asynchronous
style. A directed synchronous communication should always happen from north to south and west to east, whereas asynchronous events, commands
and messages may be interchanged in all directions to get information populated across the whole system.

**Contained Building Blocks**
[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Component** | **Responsibility**
| ERP           | The external Enterprise Resource Planning system is the host that sends higher level warehouse orders. Not part of
OpenWMS.org
| WMS Domain    | The Warehouse Management System is the layer that interacts with the ERP and implements all common warehouse processes,
like Receiving, Shipping, Inventory, Picking etc.
| TMS Domain    | The Transport Management System implements the Material Flow Control (MFC) in automatic warehouses and also the processes
used in manual warehouses
| COMMON Domain | This layer contains all essential processes and services for every warehouse solution, no matter if automatic or manual
warehouses, with or without a WMS layer. These services are always part of each customer project
| CORE Domain   | The CORE domain contains infrastructure components, that are not specific to warehouse projects and can also be used in
other arbitrary projects. Most of these services are optional to use and depend on the deployment scenario
| Subsystems    | Subsystems do not belong to OpenWMS.org, but are communication partners like PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers), scale
units, robots etc.

=== The Information Flow View
Each of the OpenWMS.org services can be assigned to one of the four domains: *CORE*, *COMMON*, *TMS* or *WMS*. A more concrete view with
seven often used microservices looks like below. Notice that the information flow is visualized not the dependency graph. *WMS* services are
not directly called from services of the *COMMON* or *TMS* domain.

|===
| **Component** | **Responsibility**
| COMMON Service           | Manages `Locations`, `LocationGroups`, `TransportUnits` and other essential domain objects that exist in
every warehouse solution.

The COMMON Service does not know about other surrounding services but sends out information to its outer components
| TMS Service   | Tracks the movement of `TransportUnits` with `TransportOrders` in automatic warehouses. The service directly uses the
interfaces of the COMMON Service
| COMMON Driver | This is the TCP/IP driver component used to communicate to subsystems that implements the https://interface21-io.gitbook.io/osip/[OSIP]
protocol. It forwards incoming messages to a routing component, like TMS Routing in an automatic warehouse
| TMS Routing   | This is a routing component used in automatic warehouses where actually the material flow control logic is defined. For
this it uses many API of other services indirectly
| WMS Inventory | This service is responsible to manage warehouse inventory, like `Products` and is mainly triggered by changes in other
components
| WMS Receiving | Warehouse receiving processes, like receipt announcements are implemented and processed here. It consumes events from
other services and directly calls API of others
| WMS Shipping  | Contains warehouse shipping processes that trigger movements

=== The Messaging Whitebox View

Lets have a closer look and look inside the microservices to see how they interact between each other. Only the asynchronous communication path
is shown with the messaging components like Message Filters, Message Queues and routing information.

Important to notice is the component who owns a shared resource. Basically queues are never shared and always kept by the service internally.
But intermediary components like Routers or Filters (here RabbitMQ exchanges) need to be accessed from both communication partners, hence a
clear ownership must be defined. As an example take the exchange with name `common.tu.commands` into account. This is owned by the
COMMON Service and used as an inbox _and_ outbox for command messages. Consumers interested in outgoing commands may subscribe a queue to
this exchange to gets updates on cache evicts or to send commands to create data managed by the COMMON service. The command structure itself
is also given by the COMMON service.

=== Package View
An OpenWMS.org microservice implementation with Java technology is structured into source packages. Some generic and often used packages
exist in all microservices with a common sense. In the example below the structure underneath the `common` package is also applied to any
other domain package like `core`, `tms` or `wms`.

Beside these packages exist dozens of others specific to every microservice. The Transportation service for example has also a separation
into functional packages, like `transports` or `routes`. The packages and conventions shown here should be followed for every OpenWMS.org
microservice implementation when possible.

|===
| **Package** | **Responsibility**
| org.openwms | Top level product package
| core        | All types that belong to the CORE domain
| common      | All types that belong to the COMMON domain
| tms         | All types that belong to the TMS domain
| wms         | All types that belong to the WMS domain
| api         | Types that are relevant for client applications or API consumers and that are cut off into a separate build artifact
| app         | Types and configuration artifacts that are responsible for the microservice lifecyle
| commands    | Contains all command types and handlers, processors of commands
| config      | Contains configuration classes responsible for the microservice external configuration, most often Spring Boot managed
classes mapped to properties files
| events      | All event types used service internally and externally. External events must put under api.events
| impl        | The internal implementation details of the microservice API
