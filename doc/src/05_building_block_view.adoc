== Building Block View

=== The Abstract View

OpenWMS.org is made up microservices that communicate between each other in a variety of protocols either in synchronous or asynchronous
style. A directed synchronous communication should always happen from north to south and west to east, whereas asynchronous events, commands
and messages may be interchanged in all directions to get information populated across the whole system.

**Contained Building Blocks**
[cols="1,2" options="header"]

|===
| **Component** | **Responsibility**
| ERP           | The external Enterprise Resource Planning system is the host that sends higher level warehouse orders. Not part of
OpenWMS.org
| WMS Domain    | The Warehouse Management System is the layer that interacts with the ERP and implements all common warehouse processes,
like Receiving, Shipping, Inventory, Picking etc.
| TMS Domain    | The Transport Management System implements the Material Flow Control (MFC) in automatic warehouses and also the processes
used in manual warehouses
| COMMON Domain | This layer contains all essential processes and services for every warehouse solution, no matter if automatic or manual
warehouses, with or without a WMS layer. These services are always part of each customer project
| CORE Domain   | The CORE domain contains infrastructure components, that are not specific to warehouse projects and can also be used in
other arbitrary projects. Most of these services are optional to use and depend on the deployment scenario
| Subsystems    | Subsystems do not belong to OpenWMS.org, but are communication partners like PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers), scale
units, robots etc.
|===

=== The Information Flow View
Each of the OpenWMS.org services can be assigned to one of the four domains: *CORE*, *COMMON*, *TMS* or *WMS*. A more concrete view with
seven often used microservices looks like below. Notice that the information flow is visualized not the dependency graph. *WMS* services are
not directly called from services of the *COMMON* or *TMS* domain.

|===
| **Component** | **Responsibility**
| COMMON Service           | Manages `Locations`, `LocationGroups`, `TransportUnits` and other essential domain objects that exist in
every warehouse solution.

The COMMON Service does not know about other surrounding services but sends out information to its outer components
| TMS Service   | Tracks the movement of `TransportUnits` with `TransportOrders` in automatic warehouses. The service directly uses the
interfaces of the COMMON Service
| COMMON Driver | This is the TCP/IP driver component used to communicate to subsystems that implements the https://interface21-io.gitbook.io/osip/[OSIP]
protocol. It forwards incoming messages to a routing component, like TMS Routing in an automatic warehouse
| TMS Routing   | This is a routing component used in automatic warehouses where actually the material flow control logic is defined. For
this it uses many API of other services indirectly
| WMS Inventory | This service is responsible to manage warehouse inventory, like `Products` and is mainly triggered by changes in other
components
| WMS Receiving | Warehouse receiving processes, like receipt announcements are implemented and processed here. It consumes events from
other services and directly calls API of others
| WMS Shipping  | Contains warehouse shipping processes that trigger movements

**Contained Building Blocks**
[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Component** | **Responsibility**
| Location Management | Functional building block to manage Locations and LocationGroups
| Transport Management | Functional building block to manage TransportUnits and TransportUnitTypes
| app | A package that contains lifecylce components of the Common Service, without any business value
| Location Tables | A set of database tables belong and accessed by the Location Management
| Transport Tables | A set of database tables belong and accessed by the Transport Management
|===

=== The Messaging Whitebox View

Lets have a closer look and look inside the microservices to see how they interact between each other. Only the asynchronous communication path
is shown with the messaging components like Message Filters, Message Queues and routing information.

[#img-05-bb-L1]

Important to notice is the component who owns a shared resource. Basically queues are never shared and always kept by the service internally.
But intermediary components like Routers or Filters (here RabbitMQ exchanges) need to be accessed from both communication partners, hence a
clear ownership must be defined. As an example take the exchange with name `common.tu.commands` into account. This is owned by the
COMMON Service and used as an inbox _and_ outbox for command messages. Consumers interested in outgoing commands may subscribe a queue to
this exchange to gets updates on cache evicts or to send commands to create data managed by the COMMON service. The command structure itself
is also given by the COMMON service.

=== Whitebox: Common Service

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

**Motivation**
Present a rough overview on how the Common Service is built internally. The service basically consists of two major functional components,
one to manage Locations and LocationGroups and one to manage TransportUnits.



**Important Interfaces**
[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Interface** | **Description**
| REST API | The public REST API is comprised of the Location Management API, the Transport Management API and an Index that lists and delegated to those two
| Async Command API | The asnychronous Command API is exposed to trigger actions on the Location- and Transport Management resources

Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.

Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system
