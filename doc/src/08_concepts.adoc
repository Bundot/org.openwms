== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Interoperability
Communication between microservices is essential. Likewise the communication format, the protocol, is essential and absolutely required to
use a well-defined structure that both communication partners, provider and consumer, understand.

Three kind of communication formats must be considered.

[#informtion-data]
==== Information Data
The actual transferred business payload between two services is the common case of microservice communication. The service provider is in
the role of upstream service and feeds all consuming services (aka. downstream services). *Hence the provider narrows the protocol and data
structures that are possible for the communication*. But the consumer may choose between options, like different representation formats
(JSON, XML, vendor specific, etc.) or transport protocols.

The consumer is responsible to transform the received structures into it’s own internal used data structures. This often happens in a
so-called ACL (Anti Corruption layer).

==== Context Data
Beside the actual business payload context relevant information must be transmitted as part of each microservice communication. For example
this is relevant to trace calls within a call chain and particular to support operationability and monitoring of a distributed system.

This contextual data is not specific to each microservice, like information data is, but has to follow a common structure that is applied in
every microservice implementation. Each microservice acts as consumer and additional as producer, respectively enricher, of context data.
Finally the transferred information must be sufficient to feed external monitoring systems with.

*Context data of OpenWMS microservices is transferred in headers, either HTTP headers or RabbitMQ headers*.

==== Failure Data
In failure situations a microservice might not respond with self-defined information data structure but with failure or error responses. The
structure and the protocol of these error responses must be consist across all microservices in order to establish communication even in
case of errors. As an example: It is not an option that Service A returns an error response to Service B that cannot be processed by
Service B because the protocol or format is unknown to Service B.

With OpenWMS we use Spring Boot as implementation framework. Spring Boot already comes with it’s own format like it exposes errors to API
consumers. For REST API over HTTP a typical Spring Boot error response looks like this:

[source,json]
----
{
    "timestamp": 1568208641323,
    "status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "exception": "org.ameba.oauth2.InvalidTokenException",
    "message": "JWT expired at 2019-09-11T13:30:41Z. Current time: 2019-09-11T13:43:27Z",
    "path": "/transport-units/S000005270119225"
}
----

This works well with Spring Boot consumers on the client side. Even clients in JavaScript can deal with this format. *The problem here is,
that the format is baked into and driven by Spring Boot and may change between mayor framework releases*.

Therefor a RFC was initiated, the Problem Details for HTTP APIs (RFC7807). By applying this RFC to all OpenWMS microservice implementations
we ensure that we align to a standardized but flexible and extendable format.

}

==== Communication Structures
This chapter describes how microservices communicate between each other. Basically two communication patterns are used:

* synchronous communication with REST API and
* asynchronous communication via RabbitMQ message broker

In all REST API the DTO (Data Transfer Objects) are called VO (View Objects), like the `LocationVO`, `LocationGroupVO` etc. These type of
classes may include hypermedia links, JSON mapping annotation etc. All those things handy for communication over HTTP.

When microservices use asynchronous messaging, the proposed data format over the wire is JSON, but also a byte array stream is possible.
JSON is better suited because it is independent from the microservice implementation technology and can be read by any language like Java,
.NET, C and many others.

In all microservices built with Java, the data structures are MO (Message Objects) that are exchanged between parties. A MO is a simple DTO
that encapsulates relevant data, like the `LocationMO`.

On consumer side the MO as well as VO need to be translated into internal structures and must not be used internally (see <<informtion-data,chapter about ACL>>)

A microservice may use internal synchronous eventing through out the Spring `ApplicationContext`. The events used internally must not be
propagated to the outside of the microservice and must be converted into a MO or VO first.
